Candango Automat-o-es
=====================


Automatoes is a `Let's Encrypt <https://letsencrypt.org>`_/
`ACME <https://github.com/ietf-wg-acme/acme/>`_
client for advanced users and developers. It is intended to be used by anyone
because we don't care if you're a robot, a processes or a person.

We will keep the `manuale` command to provide manual workflow designed by the
original project and to be a direct replacement from
`ManuaLE <https://github.com/veeti/manuale>`_.

Why?
====

Bacause Let's Encrypt's point is to be automatic and seamless and ManuaLE was
designed to be manual.

Automatoes will add automatic workflows and new features to evolve ManuaLe's
legacy. The project also will keep performing maintenance tasks as bug fixes
and refactory.

Automatoes is an ACME V2 replacement to ManuaLE.
